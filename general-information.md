The wedding cerimony and recption will both take place in Galliate Lombardo, a small village in Varese province.

### HOW TO GET THERE

Unfortunately, public transportation around to and around Galliate is not really an option. There are some buses to and from Varese, but they do not run frequently and do not operate later than 7 pm. 
Thus, having your own car or renting one is your best bet.
 
If you come from abroad, you can travel by:

* plane: closest airport is Milano Malpensa, otherwise also Milano Linate is an option.
  These airports are connected to Varese by train or buses, but you will most likely have to change train at some intermediate station - as far as we know, no direct connections are possible).
  There is a third airport as well (Orio al Serio), but it is quite a bit further.
  You can take a taxi, but expect to pay about 80 euros for a one-hour drive as they are not particularly cheap in Italy;

* train: you can travel from Milan to Varese with suburban trains every 30 minutes (~1 hr trip with line S5). Milano is connected by direct trains to Zurich and Paris as well;

* bus: Flixbus has direct overnight buses from Amsterdam to Varese (15 h).

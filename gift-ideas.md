We appreciate your presence above all, and look forward to celebrate with you!

If you want to bless us with a gift, we have put together two registries so you can help us furnish our house for our future together! Both registries contain links to the websites where you can purchase something, but you are not bound to them (i.e., if you find a better deal go ahead ðŸ˜‰). 

Unfortunately we have not managed to find a way to pay for a "fraction" of a gift online. We hope you would find collaborators if you wish.

- [general registry](https://www.myregistry.com/giftlist/maia-italo-2025): once you get an item here, please remember to mark it off (otherwise we risk receiving duplicate!). Some items have notes for better explaining what we mean;

- [Ikea registry](https://www.ikea.com/ch/en/gift-registry/guest/?id=93c31c66-dbeb-411c-b8e1-9f4b9b4c8902): you are not restricted to Ikea Switzerland, but in case you go for other Ikea locations you will have to still mark off the items here (again for preventing duplicates).

ðŸ“¦ Note on shipping: you can choose between:
    - ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ our address in Basel (Bartenheimerstrasse 4, 4055, Basel-Stadt, Switzerland);
    - ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Italo's family house (Via Leopardi 13, Bodio Lomnago, 21020, Provincia di Varese, Italy). 

You can also bring smaller items to the wedding itself if you wish
